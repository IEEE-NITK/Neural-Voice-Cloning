        Conda is a cross-platform, language-agnostic binary package manager. It is the
        package manager used by `Anaconda
        <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_ installations, but it may be
        used for other systems as well.  Conda makes environments first-class
        citizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for C
        libraries. Conda is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed open
        source.
